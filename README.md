# Ensemble_Learning_TripAdvisor_Reviews
For the Machine Learning project, I created **an ensemble** consisting of various machine learning classifiers (**a decision tree, a random forest and a support vector classifier**) to predict the classification of *TripAdvisor hotel ratings*, stemmming from *Kaggle*: https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/trip-advisor-hotel-reviews.  <br/>
Here I tackled *NLP* for the first time and applied some standard procedures for the pre-processing of the textual data: cleaning special characters and removing punctuation, cleaning digits, removing contractions, removing stopwords, lemmatization, tokenization and padding. Also, I examined **Sentiment Analysis with VADER**, i.e., how accurately the positive, neutral, and negative reviews from the data set will be recognized.
